        1. Introduction
        This guide explains how to manually encrypt your 12-word Bitcoin seed phrase using a 4-digit code and a numeric keypad (dial pad). This method provides an additional layer of security, though it's important to understand its limitations. The guide also provides a PDF template of the manual encryption method, and links to resources for generating decoy words and securely organizing your seed phrase.
        Note: This is not a seed phrase generator but a way to securely store a copy of your seed phrase.
    </p>
        <p>2. What You Need
        - 12-word BIP-39 seed phrase (generated from your Bitcoin wallet of choice)
        - The Template for the numeric keypad (0-9) with 4 sub-sections (a,b,c,d) is provided
        - A 4-digit code (digits can repeat)
        - Access to the BIP-39 word list (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/ english.txt) and a word list randomizer (https://www.random.org/lists/) to generate decoy words.
        </p>
        <p>3. Important Security Note
        This method offers only 10,000 possible combinations, which equates to about 2^13. For a method to be secure against brute-force attacks, a far greater number of combinations is requiredâ€”typically 2^128 or more. This method is not safe from brute-force decryption, so it should be used with caution. It is not recommended that this method be stored online.

        5. Step-By-Step Encryption Process
        Step 1: Choose Your 4-Digit Code
- Select a 4-digit code, where digits can repeat. This code determines the organization of your seed phrase.
- Example Code: 5273
Step 2: Divide Your Seed Phrase
- Divide your 12-word seed phrase into 4 sections, each containing 3 words. - Example:
- Seed phrase: apple banana cherry date eagle fish grape hat iron jam kite lime - Divided as:
- Section 1: apple banana cherry - Section 2: date eagle fish
- Section 3: grape hat iron
- Section 4: jam kite lime
Step 3: Assign Sections to the Code
- Each digit in your 4-digit code corresponds to a section on the keypad. Each digit has 4 sub- sections (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), allowing digits to be repeated.
Example with Code 5273: - 5a: apple banana cherry - 2a: date eagle fish
- 7a: grape hat iron
- 3a: jam kite lime
Example with Code 1223 (Repeated Digits): - 1a: apple banana cherry
- 2a: date eagle fish
- 2b: grape hat iron
- 3a: jam kite lime
Step 4: Create Decoy Sections
- For each digit and its sub-sections not used by the actual seed phrase, create decoy sections populated with random words from the BIP39 word list.
- Use the BIP-39 word list (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) and a word list randomizer (https://www.random.org/lists/) to generate decoy words.
- Example Decoys:
- 5b: water cloud bird
- 2c: mountain river tree - 7b: stone sand leaf
Step 5: Ways to Store Your Encrypted Seed Phrase
- Store multiple copies of your encrypted seed phrase offline to ensure you have backups in case one is lost or damaged.
- Seed phrases can be written on a piece of paper, in a notebook, on a Word document, etc.
